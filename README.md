# Random-Contact-Generator
This is a program that utilizes a user's complete list of their contacts: family, friends, co-workers, etc.  The program will randomly select contacts from all of these categories and recommend to the user that they contact said contacts.  The whole point behind this program is to help reduce the phenomenon of falling out of touch with the individuals in your life.
